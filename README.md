QGIS Project for UK Individual Tree Data Standard

This QGIS project has been designed for individual tree surveys in the UK. 

It complies with the Forest Research Individual Tree Data Standard.
See https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/research/quantification-and-valuation-of-benefits-provided-by-urban-trees/individual-tree-data-standard/

You could very easily use as the basis for a project in QField, the mobile version of QGIS.

You might want to host it in QFieldCloud - https://qfield.cloud/ or self-host.
